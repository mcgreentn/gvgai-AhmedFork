The game is zelda.
You are the avatar.
To move as the avatar, use the arrow keys to turn and move. Press space to use the sword (OrientedFlicker).


This is how you win:
If nokey (avatar) and key (Immovable) collide, then the nokey (avatar) sprite will be transformed into withkey (avatar).
If goal (Door) and withkey (avatar) collide, then the goal (Door) sprite will be opened.
If there are no more goal (Door) sprites then you will win.

This is how you lose:
If avatar and enemy collide, then the avatar sprite will be destroyed.
If there are no more nokey (avatar) sprites or withkey (avatar) sprites then you will lose.

This is how you get points:
If the nokey (avatar) and the key (Immovable) collide, then you will gain 1 point.
If the enemy and the sword (OrientedFlicker) collide, then you will gain 2 points.
If the goal (Door) and the withkey (avatar) collide, then you will gain 1 point.
