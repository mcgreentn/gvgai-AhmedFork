The game is aliens.
You are the FlakAvatar.
To move as the FlakAvatar, use the left and right arrow keys to move. Press space to shoot a sam (missile).


This is how you win:
If you press space, then avatar (FlakAvatar) will shoot a sam (Missile).
If alien and sam (missile) collide, then the alien sprite will be destroyed.
If there are no more portalSlow (portal) sprites or portalFast (portal) sprites or alienGreen (alien) sprites or alienBlue (alien) sprites then you will win.

This is how you lose:
If avatar (FlakAvatar) and alien collide, then the avatar (FlakAvatar) sprite will be destroyed.
If avatar (FlakAvatar) and bomb (missile) collide, then the avatar (FlakAvatar) sprite will be destroyed.
If there are no more avatar (FlakAvatar) sprites then you will lose.

This is how you get points:
If the alien and the sam (missile) collide, then you will gain 2 points.
If the base (Immovable) and the sam (missile) collide, then you will gain 1 point.
